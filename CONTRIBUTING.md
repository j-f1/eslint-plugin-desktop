# Contributing

🎉 🚀 Thanks for your interest in helping out! 🚀 🎉

Here are a few tricks to maximize the global net efficiency of your efforts.

## TL;DR: Checklist

When opening an [issue](#issues):
- [ ] search open/closed issues
- [ ] discuss bug/enhancement in new or old issue

[PR](#prs) time:
- [ ] write tests
- [ ] implement feature/fix bug
- [ ] update docs
- [ ] make a note in change log

Remember, you don't need to do it all yourself; any of these are helpful! 😎

## Issues

### Search open + closed issues for similar cases.

  You may find an open issue that closely matches what you are thinking. You
  may also find a closed issue with discussion that either solves your problem
  or explains why we are unlikely to solve it in the near future.

  If you find a matching issue that is open, and marked `accepted` and/or `help
  wanted`, you might want to [open a PR](#prs).

  Instead of commenting `+1` or `👍` on the issue, please use the “👍” reaction to indicate your support to avoid sending unnecessary emails.

### Open an issue.

  Let's discuss your issue. It could be as simple as unclear documentation or a
  wonky config file.
  If you're suggesting a feature, it might exist and need better
  documentation, or it might be in process. Even given those, some discussion might
  be warranted to ensure the enhancement is clear.

  You're welcome to jump right to a PR, but without a discussion, can't make any
  guarantees about merging.

  That said: sometimes seeing the code makes the discussion clearer. 😄

This is a helpful contribution all by itself. Thanks!

## PRs

If you would like to implement something, firstly: thanks! Community contributions
are a magical thing. They make open source possible 🚀.

**Working on your first Pull Request?**
You can learn how from this _free_ series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Here are some things to keep in mind when working on a PR:

#### Tests

A PR that is just failing test cases for an existing issue is very helpful, as this
can take as much time (if not more) as it takes to implement a new feature or fix
a bug.

If you only have enough time to write tests, fantastic! Submit away. This is a great
jumping-off point for a core contributor or even another PR to continue what you've started.

#### Docs

For enhancements to rules, please update the docs in `docs/rules` matching the rule
filename from `lib/rules`.

Also, take a quick look at the rule summary in [README.md] in case it could use tweaking,
or add a line if you've implemented a new rule.

Bugfixes may not warrant docs changes, though it's worth skimming the existing
docs to see if there are any relevant caveats that need to be removed.

## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the Contributor Covenant code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [git@twopointzero.us](mailto:git@twopointzero.us).

The TL;DR is: just be nice. Please. It saves everyone a lot of effort.
